A VS Code extension that integrates the [Brave Search API](https://brave.com/search/api/) with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling AI Copilot to perform internet searches for research and planning purposes.

## Features

This extension provides AI Copilot with the ability to:

- 🔍 **Web Search**: Search the web using Brave's independent search index
- 📰 **News Search**: Find recent news articles and current events
- 🖼️ **Image Search**: Search for images across the web

These capabilities are automatically available to GitHub Copilot and other AI assistants in VS Code when running in agent mode.

## Prerequisites

- VS Code version 1.95.0 or higher
- A Brave Search API key (free tier available)
- Node.js installed (required for running the MCP server)

## Installation

### From VSIX File (Local Installation)

1. Download or build the `.vsix` file
2. Open VS Code
3. Go to Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X)
4. Click the "..." menu at the top of the Extensions view
5. Select "Install from VSIX..."
6. Choose the downloaded `.vsix` file

### From VS Code Marketplace

Search for "Brave Search MCP" in the Extensions view and click Install.

## Getting a Brave Search API Key

1. Visit [Brave Search API](https://api.search.brave.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new API key in your dashboard
4. Copy your API key (starts with `BSA`)

### API Plans

- **Free AI**: 2,000 queries/month, 1 query/second
- **Base AI**: $5/1,000 requests, up to 20M queries/month
- **Pro AI**: $9/1,000 requests, unlimited queries

## Configuration

### Initial Setup

After installing the extension, you'll be prompted to configure your API key. You can also:

1. Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl+, / Cmd+,)
2. Search for "Brave Search MCP"
3. Enter your API key in the `Brave Search Mcp: Api Key` field

### Using Command Palette

1. Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P)
2. Type "Brave Search MCP: Configure API Key"
3. Enter your API key when prompted

### Settings

- `braveSearchMcp.apiKey`: Your Brave Search API key
- `braveSearchMcp.enabled`: Enable/disable the MCP server (default: true)

## Usage

Once configured, the Brave Search tools are automatically available to AI assistants in VS Code:

### Quick Start

1. **Open Copilot Chat** - Click the chat icon in the sidebar or use Ctrl+Shift+I (Cmd+Shift+I on Mac)
2. **Enable Agent Mode** - Click the sparkle icon (✨) in the chat input box
3. **Ask questions requiring web search** - Use natural language prompts (see examples below)

The AI will automatically use Brave Search when your question requires current information from the internet.

### Example Prompts

Try asking Copilot questions like these:

#### 🔍 Web Search Examples

- "What are the latest features in TypeScript 5.7?"
- "Find documentation for the vscode.lm API"
- "Search for best practices for React Server Components"
- "Look up the current syntax for Python async/await"
- "Find examples of using the Fetch API with error handling"
- "What's the difference between REST and GraphQL?"

#### 📰 News Search Examples

- "Find recent news about AI coding assistants"
- "What are the latest announcements from Microsoft Build?"
- "Search for news about the newest VS Code updates"
- "Find recent articles about GitHub Copilot features"
- "What's new in the JavaScript ecosystem this month?"

#### 🖼️ Image Search Examples

- "Find images of the VS Code logo"
- "Search for TypeScript architecture diagrams"
- "Find screenshots of popular VS Code themes"
- "Look for icons representing API concepts"

**💡 Tips for Best Results:**

- **Use natural language** - No special syntax or commands needed
- **Be specific** - The more specific your question, the better the results
- **Let the AI decide** - Copilot automatically chooses which search tool to use
- **Agent mode required** - Make sure the sparkle icon (✨) is active in chat

## How It Works

This extension uses the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) to connect AI assistants to the Brave Search API:

1. The extension registers an MCP server definition with VS Code
2. When activated, it launches the official `@brave/brave-search-mcp-server` package
3. The MCP server exposes search tools to AI assistants
4. AI assistants can invoke these tools automatically based on user intent
5. Search results are returned and incorporated into AI responses

## Troubleshooting

### "API key not configured" warning

- Make sure you've entered your API key in the extension settings
- Verify the API key is correct and starts with `BSA`
- Try reconfiguring using the Command Palette command

### Search tools not appearing in Copilot

- Ensure you're using VS Code 1.95.0 or higher
- Make sure Copilot is in agent mode (sparkle icon)
- Check that `braveSearchMcp.enabled` is set to `true`
- Restart VS Code after configuring the API key

### "npx command not found" error

- Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on your system
- Restart VS Code after installing Node.js
- Verify npm is in your system PATH

### Rate limiting errors

- Check your API usage in the [Brave API Dashboard](https://api.search.brave.com/)
- Consider upgrading to a paid plan if you hit the free tier limits
- See "Future Enhancements" below for planned rate limiting features

## Privacy & Security

- Your API key is stored securely in VS Code's settings
- The API key is never transmitted except to Brave's API servers
- Search queries are processed by Brave Search (see [Brave Privacy Policy](https://brave.com/privacy/))
- The extension only activates when the MCP server is requested by an AI assistant
